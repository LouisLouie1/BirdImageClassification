# BirdImageClassification
Bird Image classification workshop

This GitHub repository presents a comprehensive project from our latest workshop, focused on the practical application of deep learning techniques for image classification. The goal was to classify bird species from images, leveraging the power of neural networks. Throughout this project, we explored data preprocessing and augmentation strategies, tackled challenges like overfitting and underfitting, and experimented with different model architectures including VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3. Our aim was to provide participants with hands-on experience in optimizing models for both high accuracy and computational efficiency, preparing them to tackle real-world image classification tasks. This repository contains all the code, datasets, and detailed analyses, serving as a valuable resource for anyone interested in deep learning applications in image recognition.
