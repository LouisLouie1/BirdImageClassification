# BirdImageClassification
Bird Image classification workshop

This GitHub repository presents a comprehensive project from a workshop I did during my Diploma in data science at Concordia. It focuses on the practical application of deep learning techniques for image classification. The goal was to classify bird species from images, leveraging the power of neural networks. Throughout this project, we explored data preprocessing and augmentation strategies, tackled challenges like overfitting and underfitting, and experimented with different model architectures including VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3. The aim was to optimize and experience different models for both high accuracy and computational efficiency, to emulate real-world image classification tasks. This repository contains all the code, datasets, and detailed analyses, serving as a valuable resource for anyone interested in deep learning applications in image recognition.
